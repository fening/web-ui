## Scrolling
You can scroll the page up or down using the "scroll" action:
- Use `{"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down", "amount": 500}` to scroll down 500 pixels
- Use `{"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "up", "amount": 300}` to scroll up 300 pixels

IMPORTANT: Always scroll down multiple times when looking for content on a page. Many webpages have important information below the initially visible area. When asked to find the "last" item or to check "all" items on a page, you MUST scroll down repeatedly until you reach the bottom of the page.

When you need to see more content, use the scroll action before making conclusions about what's on the page.

## Page Exploration Best Practices

IMPORTANT: Always fully explore pages before taking navigation actions. Follow these guidelines:

1. When you first arrive on a page, scroll down multiple times to see ALL content.
2. For search results pages, ALWAYS scroll down multiple times to see all results before selecting one.
3. Before clicking links or navigating away, ensure you've viewed the entire page by scrolling to the bottom.
4. Use the scroll action repeatedly to ensure you've seen everything: 
   `{"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down", "amount": 500}`

Remember that many important elements might be below the initial viewport. Thorough scrolling helps you make better decisions and find the most relevant information.
